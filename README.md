# Howdy!
I'm **Kyle Householder**.

I'm relatively new to coding, but dabbled in C++ and BASIC some twenty years ago.

My recent motivation for learning to code began with self-study of Âµarch, and it led me down a predictable rabbit hole of assembly and low-level coding.

I have a mechanical/electrical troubleshooting background. This gives me dreams of hacking on anything within reach, exploring control systems or automation features, and merging small hardware with efficient code.

Much to my surprise, I am currently learning the fundamentals of backend web development and game design. This has led to the discovery of new possibilites, and every day I learn about some new thing I might want to create.

More about me...

## Background
I have spent 15 years in the aviation industry, first as an aircraft mechanic (for a major airline) and now as a commercial pilot & flight instructor. I've lived in the Bay Area, Denver metro, Southern California, and the Phoenix area... And I'll probably move a few more times before this career comes to a close.

My desire is to grow into a functional and competent tinkerer above all else, and to be able to quickly enter into and adapt to new technologies as needed. I love working with people who express similar curiosity in all they do, and thrive when I am surrounded by others who challenge me to continue learning and exceeding my own ability.

## **What I've been learning:**
  - **Go**
  - **Python**
  - Network management & self hosted services
  - Planning how to serve fully featured sites and applications to remote users
### Projects:
1. **Logbook App:** I want build a single-user service to capture some specific data I currently track manually in spreadsheets. Ideally this is mobile friendly, and provides nice data analysis/views.
2.  **Maintenance Tracker:** I would like to develop a fully functional planning/scheduling, logging, and reporting service for aircraft maintenance and repair. The goal is a highly configurable and fully-featured suite that assists instead of hinders users that are in the field supporting fleet airworthiness.
3.  **Puzzle Game:** A 2D top-down game where the user must navigate obstacles, enemies, and unique movement strategy to solve a number of increasingly difficult levels with weighted scoring.
